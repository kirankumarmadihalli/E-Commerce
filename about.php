                    <p><b>E-Store</b> is an Indian e-commerce company based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. 
                        It was founded by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007. The company initially focused on book sales, 
                        before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials &
                        groceries, and lifestyle products.The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the
                        domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce 
                        industry.[7] Flipkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by 
                        its acquisition of Myntra), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics 
                        and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

                    <p style="color: blue">2011-</p>
                    <p> Flipkart made several acquisitions relating to digital distribution, including Mime360.com[15] and the digital content library of Bollywood portal Chakpak.  </p>
                    <p style="color: blue">2012-</p>
                    <p> The company unveiled its DRM-free online music store Flyte. However, the service was unsuccessful due to competition from free streaming sites, and shut down in June 2013., Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer.</p>
                    <p style="color: blue">2014-</p>
                    <p>in honour of the company's anniversary and the Diwali season,[32] Flipkart held a major sale across the service that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of goods in 10 hours. The event received criticism via social media over technical issues the site experienced during the event, as well as stock shortages.[</p>
                    <p style="color: blue">2015-</p>
                    <p>Flipkart blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the site's mobile app instead. The following month, Myntra went further and discontinued its website on all platforms, in favour of operating exclusively through its app. The "app-only" model, however, proved to be unsuccessful for Myntra (reducing sales by 10%), and its main website was reinstated in February 2016. The experiment with Myntra led to suggestions that Flipkart itself would perform a similar move, but this did not occur. In November 2015</p>
